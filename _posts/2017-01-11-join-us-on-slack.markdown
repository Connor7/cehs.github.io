We now have our very own Slack! Slack is a messaging app for teams that allows easy communication, file sharing and integrations.

Our Slack group is [https://cehscoding.slack.com](https://cehscoding.slack.com). You can invite yourself to our Slack by using this [sign-in page](http://cehscoding.herokuapp.com/) or clicking the Slack button at the bottom of the page.

On Slack we will have discussions about the inner workings of CEHS Coding Club, as well as general coding and tech discussions.

We ask that you behave appropriately on our Slack.
